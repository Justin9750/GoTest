This is my first attempted project on making a working Go Language program with SQL Server Management Services integration.
In this project, I used the gorm.io framework to do basic CRUD operations to the database inside a server in my internship office.
I haven't really added much to the UI and design of the project, but I do consider them to function properly when opened on a mobile device.

By following some online guides from various websites and YouTube videos, I am able to make a functional localhost website that can execute commands into the SSMS database.

Here are some little documentation of what the first iteration of the website looks like (I've already updated the source code, but haven't done another documentation)
